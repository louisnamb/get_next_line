In this example, we will explain how to open and read a file using the open() 
and read() functions.

For this purpose, we previously created a text file with the name, “example.txt”, 
via the Linux Manager and saved it in the “Documents” directory. We wrote the first 
paragraph of this article in it.

The first step in developing the code to read the file is to include the necessary 
headers and create a main() function that returns an empty value. We define the “fd” 
integer in it which serves as the file descriptor, a 1024 character buffer called 
“buff” where the information that is read by the read() function is stored. 
The array path stores the path and the name of the file that we want to read.Welcome to GFG
